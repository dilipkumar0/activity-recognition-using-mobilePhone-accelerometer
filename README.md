# activity-recognition-using-mobilePhone-accelerometer

The present day technology trends have led to remake mobile phone gadgets as a technical advancement which eases
the life of a person. The mobile phones have grown more sophisticated as they are embedded with numerous sensors like
GPS sensor, direction sensor i.e., the magnetic compasses, audio sensor i.e., the microphone, light sensor, vision sensor i.e.,
the camera, temperature sensor, and the acceleration sensors i.e., accelerometer. In this paper, we have built a system to
recognise/describe the physical activity of a person using the accelerometer sensor of the mobile phone. We have trained
the system using the data collected from multiple human subjects in the real-world scenario while they performed activities
like walking, standing, sitting, walking-upstairs, walking-downstairs. Several classifiers were tested using various statistical
features. We have selected six classifiers based on the above listed activities each offering a decent performance for recognizing
our set of activities and studied how to combine all into an optimal set of classifiers. We found that using the random forest
classification model we reach an overall accuracy rate of 70%.
